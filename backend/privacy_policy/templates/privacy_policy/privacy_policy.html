        <h4>Suggestions for applicants using the site</h4>
        <p>For maximum privacy, consider using an anonymous email or email masking service, so that anyone getting access to your email cannot trace your identity backwards.</p>
        <p>It is possible and recommended to use an alias to create an applicant file.</p>
        <p>To ensure maximum privacy, it is also recommended to not include any personal identifier like driverâ€™s license number, postal code or phone number in any applicant profile field.</p>
        <p>If you need to include third-party sites that include your work, it would be best to configure that site so that you are not traceable from there either.</p>
        <p>Semi-identifiers like the city you are currently living in, the universities you went to, or the companies you worked for previously might be necessary for a decent knowledge about the applicant and for a HR personnel to be interested in you.</p>
        <p>You can trust your profile with us: we have an encryption program that encrypts your profiles before then are stored, and we do not simply retrieve your profile, decrypt it, and start reading it either.</p>
        <p>You have unlimited access to your stored profile content, and you can view, modify and delete your profile content at any time.</p>
        <p>Your profile information is immediately wiped from our database upon its deletion. We do not retain your profiles for an extended amount of time.</p>
